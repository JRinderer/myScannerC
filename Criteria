   *****SUMMARY: Outlined below are the basic overall requirements for the KLUMP languaged as well as the types of:
    *****{Characters, Numbers, Operators, etc} that will be found in the KLUMP. language. Brief description
    *****will be provided.

        - Requirements for Language: These are the general rules/criteria/actions/features the language must contain.
            1. procedural.
            2. Typed.
            3. Fixed length types.
            4. Allows structured data types (arrays, records, fixed length string literals).
            5. No dynamic structures.
            6. Global and local scope.
            7. Require declaration before definition or reference.
            8. Static allocation for global variables.
            9. Automatic allocation for local variables (NO DYNAMIC ALLOCATION).
            10. Call by value and call by variable (structured data types must be call by reference).
            11. Recursion is permitted by default.
            12. Return types are limited by atomic data types ONLY.

        -Character set for KLUMP: These characters are either **char** or **int** types
            1. A - Z (FORCE UPPER CASE ON ALL CHARACTERS) -- Break out into LETTERS TYPE?
            2. 0 - 9 -- Break out into NUMBERS TYPE?

        -Reserved Words for KLUMP: These words are key words that indicate some action for the compiler to take
            1. AND
            2. ARRAY
            3. ASCII
            4. BEGIN
            5. BOOL
            6. BREAK
            7. CALL
            8. CASE
            9. CONST
            10. CSTRING
            11. DCL
            12. DECIMAL
            13. DEFAULT
            14. DO
            15. DOWNTO
            16. ELSE
            17. END
            18. FOR
            19. GLOBAL
            20. GOTO
            21. IF
            22. INT
            23. NEXT
            24. NOT
            25. NUMBER
            26. OF
            27. OR
            28. PROC
            29. PROCEDURE
            30. READ
            31. READLN
            32. REAL
            33. RECORD
            34. RETURN
            35. STRING
            36. THEN
            37. TO
            38. TYPE
            39. VAR
            40. WHILE
            41. WRITE
            42. WRITELN

         -Operators for KLUMP: These will need further work to break down into Sub groups mathematical vs operational.
         These can be assigned a TOKEN that is their LEXEME.
		A. Punctuation:
	            1. :
	            2. ;
	            3. .
	            4. (
	            5. )
	            6. {
	            7. }
	            8. [
	            9. ]
		B. Relational Operators:
	            1. :=
	            2. =
	            3. <>
	            4. <
	            5. >
	            6. <=
	            7. >=
	            8. +
	            9. -
	            10. *
	            11. /
	            12. %
