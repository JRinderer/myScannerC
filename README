==================================README - KLUMP SCANNER - JRinderer===================================================
---------OVERVIEW: This is a project for my graduate studies. The goal is to develop a compiler for a programming
---------language using C to build a scanner/parser/compiler to ultimately translate the source code in X86_64 Assemlby.
---------This README file will contain an overview (and be updated for my own notes) of the functions/headers/modules.
---------It will be more general than the notes section, focusing on a higher level overview. If you're interested in
---------more detailed notes please see the Notes text file. This contains my day-to-day notes as I work through the
---------project. This README is incomplete, and will be updated as I make progress. I read an article on building a
---------scanner in C, which I site below and offer the link to.

------------Developer - John Rinderer
------------Date - 1/3/2018
------------Developed Using:
--------------------------C99 programming language
--------------------------GCC Compiler Version: 5.4.0 & 7.2.1
--------------------------CMake Version: 3.5 or 3.8
--------------------------Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (NA) & Arch Linux 64 bit (4.14.9-1)
--------------------------IDE: CLion
--------------------------CMake files require RELOADING when switching between OS's or verions of CMake. See
--------------------------Instructions section for further details.
***********************************************************************************************************************
---------Instructions:
------------In order for CMake to work correctly you will need to either modify the attached CMake files
------------or if you're using an IDE you can reload the CMakeLists.txt. This will re-apply any updates. If you're using
------------and older version than 3.8 you'll need to modify CMakeLists.txt by finding the following:
------------cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8) and editing. As an example my Ubunutu Linux uses 3.5 I change this and
------------reload CMake, which should resolve the problem. However, if your IDE does not allow you to easily reload
------------CMake files then you can edit them yourself. You'll need to ensure the directory the files are located in
------------changes. Your directory tree will be different than mine, editing these paths should resolve the CMake
------------errors your encounter.
***********************************************************************************************************************
---------Sources:
-----------Source code based on the following project: Original Source code From: Lexical Analyzer Project: Loc Nguyen
-----------https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/833206/Lexical-analyzer-an-example This Source code above is being used
-----------as a base to build a Compiler in the C Programming language. It serves as an example and reference only, and
-----------will be modified. Source code files can be downloaded from the article listed on codeproject.com.
***********************************************************************************************************************
---------Functions Overview:
------------main.c:
--------------------------main(): function takes command line arguments, doesn't require the extension (appends),
--------------------------verifies the file exists, verifies the file isn't empty, and checks the characters within the
--------------------------the file to ensure they meet the overall criteria. Example - If some character that isn't
--------------------------part of the language is present an error message with the character/word will be displayed and
--------------------------the line. Once the verification is complete the main() calls getTokenType().
